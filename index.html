            <p>&emsp;The boy walked out of his hut and into the field, overcome by a sense of gratitude- this was all he'd ever known. The blades of grass tickled him, slipping in and out
            between his toes, the frosty dew soothing to his bare, caloused feet. His breath hung on the crisp crisp autumn air, which the sun penetrated through with surprising ease,
            warming his skin despite the cold air around him. Taking in a few exhilarting breathes, the boy plunged into the lake, fully waking him as if a gong had been struck.
            After a seemingly inhuman amount of time beneath the waters, the boy broke the surface and swam towards the banks. A wide exhilarted grin swathed across his face, a remnant
            of his youthful charm, contrasting with icy eyes that projected a sober mind and many lifetimes of maturity.</p>

            <p>&emsp;The boy quickly dried himself and made his way to nearby shed, where he would meticulously develop the tools needed for the day's work. More often than not, the maintenence 
            of his small arsenal took the majority of the day. Today he would have to venture out into the nearby wooded area for good timber, fuel for his furnace and to stave off the 
            encroaching cold... winter was coming. In his youth, he would have grabbed his trusty blade to start hacking away at the dense bark of the tree, exhausting the blade as 
            quickly as his energy and resolve. No longer the foolish master, He had gained wisdom in his folly, tending to the needs of his esate before yielding to his youthful undirected 
            impulses. Leaving himself with no energy left him defenseless to secure what little he strived so hard to hold on to. Now, he would spend a good amount of the day 
            sharpening his saw- much more efficient this way. The progress was far more consistent and reliable, leaving him with the necessary strength which is needed to fend off the 
            raiders who relentlessly encroached on his territory. Though their attacks was seemingly random, as sure as the sun rose, they would come at some point throughout the day.
            They would find him ready and well prepared.</p>
            
            <p>&emsp;But first things first, he would have to tend to the horses he had... or to be more accurate the Horses who had him... They were more than his most prized possessions, more than his
            best friends- they were intimately apart of him... or the other away around maybe? It was hard to be certain. So much rich history together, Like any familial bond- full of 
            trust and hardships alike. They were a seemingly fickle lot to the untrained eye, but their loyalty was unquestionable- if you proved worthy enough to mount them. A few 
            times he had lost their approval, the Horses would only stay with those who upheld their principles and cared for them daily. Good/Evil, Friend or Foe alike- the judgements 
            of mankind mattered not. Their instincts seemed based on Forces Primodial- and only the worthy were allowed to claim them. If you could say anything about them- they were 
            fair in that regard. When the boy was younger, he had lost their favor, and the aftermath was too costly to repeat. He became unable to swallow and his stomach clenched into
            a knot at the memory, as it played across his mind's eye...</p>

            <p class = "FlashBack">&emsp;The seedlings he so carefully planted and placed his fragile hopes in, burned to cinders- trampled under the firey hoofs of the "Second". Molten horseshoe prints (a strange 
            mixture, seemingly of pitch and iron) branded the earth, scarring it, making it barren and unusable. The "Third" was a wierd one, everywhere it skittered caused massive con-
            fusion and dismay among any living thing. The animals of the field who would usually lay dormant, bolted from thier dens swept up in mass hysteria. Maddening screams,
            hisses, and growls fill the air, along with the cloying scent of blood... though in hindsight, it could have been from the trickle of blood rolling down his chin as his own
            blood began to boil, biting his lip to keep a grip on sanity- on the real. The "Fourth" horse sauntered proudly. Whole swaths of the field turning bone white in its presence,
            erasing of all semblance of light and warmth. Plants and animals grew and died in seconds, always in sickness and agony. And on the hill overlooking the whole ordeal was the 
            "First". It's gaze heavy with a mixture of disdain and apathy, seemed to penetrate the boy to the core. And though far away, he could make out every facet of the "Fourth's"
            eyes as if he were close enough to brush its mane. It's rider let loose a fiery arrow that soared across the inky black sky, taking a strangely long time as it traveled and 
            growing exponetially brighter the closer it came. Finally with a soft whistle, it struck a key pillar of his dwelling that he so painstakingly put together, sending a spiderweb
            of cracks along the post. First a hush... then a blinding explosion flung him like a ragdoll into the field. Light, dark, a mouthful of soil, the mettalic taste
            of blood, bones and sinew snapping as he tumbled through the night. Finally rolling to a stop, he felt the last of his strength leave his body and his consciousness fade, 
            the peircing stare from the First never leaving him.</p>
            

            <p>&emsp;Shaking the memory from his head, he reminded himself that that was the past, things were different, HE was different. Back then he was naive, he was that no more. A lot 
            had happened since then- They were loyal to him now, but only after he was was loyal to them, not before. A king may have many servants, but a king must be the greatest
            servant of them all if his nation is to prosper. This territory wasn't much, but it was his, and his responsibility to rule properly. A smile tugged at his lips as he crossed
            the threshold into the barn to greet his old friends once more.</p>
